a 92
# dump current state of allocbuf to show how much is left
d
# allocate a block using up all of the remaining memory
a 692
# dump current state of allocbuf to show it's empty
d

# free a block that is between two blocks in use
f 1
# dump current state of allocbuf
d
# free a block at bottom of allocbuf with an inuse block above it
f 3
# dump current state of allocbuf
d
# free a block with free blocks above and below it
f 2
# dump current state of allocbuf to show effect of coalesce
d
# free last block at top of allocbuf with a free block below it
f 0
# try to free a block that is not in use any longer (should fail)
f 0
# dump final state of allocbuf which should be same as initial state
d
# and quit the test
